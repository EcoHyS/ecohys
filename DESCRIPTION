Description: Implementation of a one layer physically based model for mass
    balance dynamics of a seasonal snowpack. It simulates the snowpack's
    composition over time (hourly), including snow depth, density, SWE,
    liquid water content, and refreezing. A hybrid model which combines a
    temperature-index approach (HyS 1.0; ref?) with a physically based
    energy-budget approach (Kondo et al., 1990).
